Hello there. Meet Abhishek. Hope you are enjoying reading my blogs.
I am a student pursuing a course in Information Technology from NIT Durgapur
which will end by 2019 thus completing my graduation having a B. Tech. degree
in my hands.

That was enough from an academic perspective. But actually I am not good at
academics. I am more of an independent learner mostly watching videos and
reading blogs. I love teaching more than learning but when I do that I am
tired by the end of the day. This process happens because there are no
professional people preaching/teaching open source technologies in a/our
college. So, it all depends on the students making new clubs and communities
to introduce different open source technologies to other students.

It all started in standard 10. I used to create simple web pages using HTML
and CSS. But when I got into high school it all changed. I was learning to code
simple programs in C++ using Turbo C++ as my one and only IDE.

**Manohar Da**, my programming tutor told me how to manipulate colors in
`Turbo C++`. This brought me into making small projects thus enhancing my
programming skills.

I am stopping here because I just had to mention my tutor. My biography
would take too long to write. Drop me questions/suggestions on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im). We can have a good talk there.

Have a good day.
