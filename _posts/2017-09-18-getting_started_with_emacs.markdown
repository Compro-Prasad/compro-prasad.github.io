## Target Readers
Newbies trying to learn Emacs.

## Inspiration behind this post
First of all, Emacs is not dead. Its under active development. Emacs is an
editor of a lifetime powerful enough to do any computational task.

## What is Emacs?
An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more. At its core is
an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with
extensions to support text editing.

## Why use Emacs?
1) It has been around for more than 40 years and its community is still growing
so there is a **high chance** that it will **still be under active development**
for at least another 40 years.

2) Most of today's **interpreters ship with GNU Readline** support which are
**based on the Emacs keybindings**.

3) You can get to a point of **developing a plugin for Emacs or even Emacs
itself** more quickly than any software you use because this software is based
on **community development**.

4) Get more **granular functionality** in comparison to other editors you use.

5) You can **customize Emacs in Real Time** i.e the changes are visible as soon
as you change any variable in Emacs. After all Lisp machines were made for this
purpose only. So, **no need of frequent restarts**.

6) Emacs is an editor/lisp machine which **knows about itself** and would
**share any information** with you if you would like to.

7) You have **enough free time**.

## Why not use Emacs?
1) Never try Emacs if you are in a hurry to give a good powerpoint presentation
the next day. **So, no impatient users are allowed.**

2) You **expect** everything should be there/done **as your previous editor**.

3) Its **not a get set go editor**. Sure it can be but not for the first time
you use it.

4) You **hate lisp** badly.

5) You **dont like using free/libre software**.

6) You want to **concentrate more on actual projects** than on the tools you
use.

7) You are **not ready to learn new things**.

## Exercise
